    <div class="testimonial">
      <p>"Kaijie is a natural leader who carries himself with confidence, clarity, and empathy. He takes initiative, communicates effectively, and often steps up to guide and support his peers. Whether it's in class discussions or group projects, Kaijie consistently shows responsibility, maturity, and a strong sense of direction. I’m confident these qualities will serve him well in a dynamic course like Mechatronics."– Mr Winston Chew</p>
    </div>
    <div class="testimonial">
      <p>"Problem‑Solving & Innovation: Kaijie has shown exceptional skill in not only tackling challenges but also in supporting classmates. When friends are unsure about a concept, Kaijie listens carefully to their concerns and adapts explanations—sometimes using different analogies, step‑by‑step breakdowns, or visual aids—to ensure clarity. This ability to listen, identify misunderstandings, and creatively convey ideas makes Kaijie a natural tutor and problem‑solver. By teaching peers, Kaijie reinforces their own understanding while enhancing others’. Such peer‑instruction practices are known to deepen mastery and foster collaborative innovation" – Mr Peter Ong</p>
