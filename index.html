    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <div class="testimonial">
      <p>"Kai Jie serves as the Class Chairperson throughout Secondary 1 to 4, a role he has carried out with great responsibility and initiative. He consistently takes proactive steps to ensure the well-being, safety, and cohesion of his classmates. His leadership has been marked by a quiet confidence and steady reliability. These qualities earned him the respect of both peers and teachers and he was unanimously voted to be the chairperson of his form class across his years in secondary school. He frequently supports his teachers in administrative duties and helps facilitate smooth classroom routines, demonstrating excellent organisation skills and attention to detail. "– Ms Toh Si Qi</p>
    </div>
    <div class="testimonial">
      <p>"Problem‑Solving & Innovation: Kaijie has shown exceptional skill in not only tackling challenges but also in supporting classmates. When friends are unsure about a concept, Kaijie listens carefully to their concerns and adapts explanations—sometimes using different analogies, step‑by‑step breakdowns, or visual aids—to ensure clarity. This ability to listen, identify misunderstandings, and creatively convey ideas makes Kaijie a natural tutor and problem‑solver. By teaching peers, Kaijie reinforces their own understanding while enhancing others’. Such peer‑instruction practices are known to deepen mastery and foster collaborative innovation" – Mr Peter Ong</p>
